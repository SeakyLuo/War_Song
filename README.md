The game itself will also tell you where you can place your piece. And we have tactics for players to use.

This game works best with Windows and with Resolution 1920×1080. Fairly compatible with 1280×720.
Mac and Linux not recommended.

Usage:
1. Download the zip file called "build.zip"
2. Unpack it.
3. Open "build.exe" if using Windows, "build.app" if Mac.
4. Select your resolution (Strongly recommend 1920*1080 on Windows)
5. Click "Play" and enjoy!

Note:
1. Our network hasn't had its full functionality yet so everything is still local
2. But you still need to login with email 1@1.com and password 12345678.
3. We haven't implemented all the piece abilities and tactic effects yet, so some cards will not work as expected.
4. You can't match other players as well but you can eplore the game mode by clicking around.
4. You can get coins as many as possible from the merchant on the left of Recruitment page (since we have not finish network part yet), and coins can be used as purchasing contracts to get cards. You need to drag your contract to the empty space to get your cards.
