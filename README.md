Basic game rules (piece movement) please see the link below.

The game itself will also tell you where you can place your piece. And we have tactics for players to use.

This game only works with Windows and has the best performance with Resolution 1920×1080. It is fairly compatible with 1280×720.
Mac and Linux are not supported.

Usage:
1. Download the zip file called "Builds.rar"
2. Unpack it.
3. Open "build.exe".
4. Select your resolution (Strongly recommend 1920*1080 by unchecking Windowed)
5. Click "Play" and enjoy!

Note:
1. You can either create your own account or choose our existing account with email 1@1.com and password 12345678.
2. We haven't implemented all the piece abilities and tactic effects yet, so some cards will not work as expected.
3. Our network hasn't had its full functionality yet, so you can't match other players as well but you can enter and eplore the game mode by clicking around. And the response will be slow when using contract in the Recruit. Additionally, the json of Unity has some problems, so you will lose some data after you exit game and login again.
4. You can get coins as many as possible from the merchant on the left of Recruit (since we have not finish network part yet), and coins can be used as purchasing contracts to get cards. You need to drag your contract to the empty space to get your cards.
5. There is a GuideBook in the settings panel, but it's not done yet. Please don't open it.
